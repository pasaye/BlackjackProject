# BlackjackProject


## Overview 
For this project the user can play blackjack until the dealer runs out of cards. The user selects play and the game starts. 
The dealer shuffles through the cards and deals based on the results the user can decide to stand or hit. If the user adds 
a card to their hand and can continue to do so until the select stand or go over 21(bust aka lose). On selecting stand the 
player ends their turn and the dealer draws cards until they win or lose. the player with the highest card value wins if 
either player goes over 21 its a loss.

#### Lessons Learned

Understanding: I've been trying to understand code the way my cohort or instructors understand it, but I have to code how I 
understand it. For instance when I ask for help I understand what is being said to me or the path the code is taking(I can 
read it),but I'm confused on why I didn't see something that was so obvious once it was pointed out. I always feel confused 
on because my brain doesn't work the same way there's does. I just need to learn how things work and use them how I see them 
being used instead of trying to use code the way other see it.

Working Backwards?: I'v been having difficulty conceptualizing how to build an app working from a class towards a main. So, I
threw it all out and started to work from the main out. It's easier for me to start from the from the main and think "OK, what's 
the next step?" and then connect the classes from there. Instead of working from the classes towards the main. For instance, going 
through the steps of how the game starts. OK, the dealer deals, what do I need? a deck to build a hand.(It's turns out I was probably
confused because we started with classes instead of staring with the main).

Broken code: I absolute shattered my code(Sunday Morning). I was putting so much logic into to methods and passing parameters and arguments that I got mixed up and couldn't figure what belonged to what. It also made me question whether not the code I was putting into my methods was really OOP? I wound up seeing that I wasn't even using most of the methods I put into the classes. I was mainly just relying on the deal method. 

Stack Overflow: I used and loved the site a lot before this course, but since starting this course I've grown to love it even more.
