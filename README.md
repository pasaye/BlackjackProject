# BlackjackProject


## Overview 
For this project the user can play blackjack until the dealer runs out of cards. The user selects play and the game starts. 
The dealer shuffles through the cards and deals based on the results the user can decide to stand or hit. If the user adds 
a card to their hand and can continue to do so until the select stand or go over 21(bust aka lose). On selecting stand the 
player ends their turn and the dealer draws cards until they win or lose. the player with the highest card value wins if 
either player goes over 21 its a loss.

#### Lessons Learned

Understanding: I've been trying to understand code the way my cohort or instructors understand it, but I have to code how I 
understand it. For instance when I ask for help I understand what is being said to me or the path their code is taking(I can 
read it), I always feel confused on how they thought of said path. I just need to learn how things work and use them how I 
see them being used instead of trying to use code the way other see it.

Working Backwards?: I'v been having difficulty conceptualizing how to build an app working from a class towards a main. So, I
threw it all out and started to work from the main out. It's easier for me to start from the from the main and think "OK, what's 
the next step?" and then connect the classes from there. For instance, going through he steps of how the game starts. OK, the dealer deals, what do I need? a deck to build a hand. So, I go to the class and add what I need instead of build the class and then attaching
it to the main. 

Frustration: I annoyed with how confused I am. I'm really grateful for the slow down over the next week to study and really solidify the
concepts. I'm confident that that will ease most my confusion.
